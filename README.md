![Portfolio Screenshot](assets/img/portfolio/app-iportafolio1.png)

**iPortfolio** is a modern, responsive personal portfolio website showcasing the professional experience, skills, and projects of Xavier Clemente, a Full Stack Developer with expertise in Java, Spring, React, Angular, and AWS. The site is built using the [iPortfolio Bootstrap template](https://bootstrapmade.com/iportfolio-bootstrap-portfolio-websites-template/) from BootstrapMade and deployed as a static site on AWS S3, with CloudFront for content delivery and Route 53 for domain management.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports English and Spanish via i18n translations.
- **Interactive Portfolio**: Displays projects with filters (All, App, Java, Python, AWS) using Isotope.js.
- **Contact Form**: Integrated with AWS API Gateway and Lambda for form submissions (requires backend setup).
- **Skills Section**: Visual progress bars for technical skills (Java, Spring, React, AWS, etc.).
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and effects powered by AOS (Animate On Scroll).
- **Social Media Links**: Connects to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Skype, and LinkedIn.

## Prerequisites

To develop or deploy the site, ensure you have:
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) for local testing.
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and configured for deployment (`aws configure`).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.
- Optional: A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iportfolio.git
   cd iportfolio
   ```

2. **Serve Locally**:
   - Use a local web server to test the site (e.g., Python's HTTP server):
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
   - Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

3. **Modify Content** (optional):
   - Edit `index.html`, `portfolio-details.html`, etc., to update content.
   - Update `assets/img/` for custom images.
   - Modify `assets/js/i18n.js` for translations or `assets/css/main.css` for styling.

## Deployment to AWS S3

The site is deployed as a static website on an AWS S3 bucket, with CloudFront for CDN and Route 53 for domain routing. The `deploy.ps1` script automates the deployment process.

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI installed and configured with credentials (`aws configure`).
- An S3 bucket configured for static website hosting (e.g., `s3://iportfolio-static-site-dev-92c7c0c2`).
- Permissions to write to the S3 bucket.

### Deployment Steps
1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\xv2\portfolioXv\iPortfolio
   ```

2. **Run the Deployment Script**:
   ```powershell
   .\deploy.ps1
   ```
   - The script uses `aws s3 sync` to upload files to the S3 bucket, excluding patterns from `.gitignore` (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`, `.vscode`) and specific files (e.g.,`.gitignore`).
   - The `--delete` flag ensures that files no longer in the local directory are removed from the bucket.

3. **Verify the Bucket**:
   ```powershell
   aws s3 ls s3://iportfolio-static-site-dev-92c7c0c2/ --recursive
   ```
   Expected files:
   - `index.html`
   - `README.md`
   - `deploy.ps1`
   - `assets/*`
   - `forms/*`
   - `views/*`

4. **Access the Site**:
   - Use node.js http server: 
     ```
     npm install -g http-server
     http-server
     ```
     Open http://localhost:8080/
   - Use the CloudFront distribution URL https://d345fgvqskm7oo.cloudfront.net/
   - If using a custom domain, configure Route 53 to point to CloudFront.

### Infrastructure
The static site is part of a broader AWS architecture, including:
- **S3**: Hosts static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images).
- **CloudFront**: Provides CDN and caching for faster delivery.
- **Route 53**: Manages the custom domain (e.g., `www.xvclemente.com`).
- **API Gateway and Lambda**: Handle dynamic form submissions (see `validate.js`).

For a detailed architecture diagram and backend setup, refer to the [infrastructure repository](https://github.com/your-username/infrastructure-repo) (placeholder, update with the actual link).

## Contact Form Setup

The contact form (`index.html`, `#contact`) submits data to an AWS API Gateway endpoint backed by a Lambda function. To enable form submissions:

1. **Update `validate.js`**:
   - Replace the placeholder `apiUrl` in `assets/js/validate.js` with your API Gateway endpoint:
     ```javascript
     const apiUrl = 'https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/contact';
     ```

2. **Deploy the Backend**:
   - Set up the Lambda function and API Gateway as described in the infrastructure repository.
   - Ensure the Lambda function processes the JSON payload from the form (name, email, subject, message).

3. **Test the Form**:
   - Submit a test form and verify the response in the browser console or Lambda logs.
   - The form displays "Your message has been sent. Thank you!" on success or an error message on failure.
