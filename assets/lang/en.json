Features include responsive design, JavaScript-based i18n for multi-language support, dynamic loading of the shared header, and API-driven contact form submission.

          "descInfra": "The entire AWS infrastructure (S3, CloudFront, OAC, Lambda, API Gateway, IAM Roles/Policies, SES Identity/Permissions) is defined and managed using Terraform, promoting consistency and version control (IaC). The infrastructure code resides in a separate repository from the application code, following best practices for separation of concerns. CloudFront provides CDN caching, HTTPS, and secure access to the private S3 bucket via Origin Access Control (OAC).",
          "learningsTitle": "Key Learnings & Challenges",
          "descLearnings": "This project involved learning and overcoming challenges related to configuring CloudFront OAC, correctly scoping IAM permissions for Lambda and SES, debugging serverless functions using CloudWatch Logs, and managing infrastructure state with Terraform. It served as practical experience in building and deploying a full-stack serverless application on AWS.",
